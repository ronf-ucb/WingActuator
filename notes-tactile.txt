Bringing up tactile sensor on K64F
July 10, 2019

1. How to get pins screen to see package?
right click on project name -> MCUXpresso config tools -> pins
(can not click directly on pins tab- gives blank)

2. What is maximum baud rate?
64 x 4 char (3 digits + space) = 256 char * 200 Hz = 50kByte/sec = 400 kbaud
K64F tech ref manual:52.4.2.9 Baud rate tolerance 
MAx baud rate = UART clock /16
https://mcuoneclipse.com/2014/06/14/frdm-k64f-atmaximum-speed-of-120-mhz/
drivers/fsl_uart.h initializes to 115200

https://mcuxpresso.nxp.com/apidoc/group__uart__driver.html

Quick Settings -> SDK Debug Console
PRINTF?
Advanced settings: C/C++ Library Settings -> Redirect SDK PRINTF
(not sure how this can be done once project is already installed)
#define BOARD_DEBUG_UART_BAUDRATE 9600 
and then use 
UART_Init(UART0, &config, DEMO_UART_CLK_FREQ);
(DEMO_UART_CLK_FREQ is defined in CLOCK_GetFreq(UART0_CLK_SRC)
pyserial: Standard values above 115200, such as: 230400, 460800, 500000, 576000,
921600, 1000000, 1152000, 1500000, 2000000, 2500000, 3000000, 3500000, 4000000
 also work on many platforms and devices.
 
 Changed BOARD_DEBUG_UART_BAUDRATE to 230400: ok.
 1152000 is garbled
 1000000 works ok on putty
 
 3. Analog input range:
 VAIO Analog1, RESET, EXTAL, and XTAL input voltage –0.3 VDD + 0.3 V
 
 4. IO connections:
 use J6 on K64F, 8 pin connections
 
 5. how to enable floating point and printing?
 Quickstart -> Quick Settings -> Set Floating Point type
 Hard ABI (pass floating point in registers)
 
 5.1  Quick Settings→Set Library Header type→NewlibNano (semihost)
 5.2  NewlibNano:   If  your  codebase  does  require  floating  point  variants  of printf/scanf, 
 then these can be enabled by going to:
 •Project→Properties→C/C++ Build→Settings→MCU Linker→Managed  Linker  Script 
 and  selecting  the  ”Enable  printf/scanf float” tick box.
  also C/C++ Build -> Settings->MCU C Compiler -> Preprocessor->PRINTF_FLOAT_ENABLE=1
 CR_INTEGER_PRINTF - Undefine/Remove this directive
 
 6. Timing is off, are clocks set same as race-timer?
 Maybe UART baudrate changed timing? Needed to change FreeRTOSConfig.h
 
 7. Using A/D in software triggered mode.
 Ref manual p. 847, chap 35
 Copy example from k64_adc
 missing BOARD_INITPINS_ADC0_SE12_GPIO_PIN- need to set _Identifier_ in pin config tool!
 (can not leave blank- then will not generate code.)
 
 8. How does getchar work? semiconsole or UART? 
 use GETCHAR? Seems to hang in GETCHAR. need to debug reading a character.
 PUTCHAR and GETCHAR work, but SCANF does not echo, and terminates on space, not <cr>
 scanf went right to hardfault on single-step, maybe not linked in?
 
 9. can't see tactile_project when loading into mcuxpresso on haydn? Something with .cproject or .project?
 These look identical. May need to just recreate project?
 Or export as archive and reimport? But want to use github for compatability...
 maybe .settings?
  can't open project Tactile, but can open Tactile1?
  try just copying an existing directory into its own location, w/o workspace?
 worked ok for RaceTimer3. 
 Tried copying tactile_project: Source Path Too Long: org.eclipse.egit.core.
 Now opens ok, since this file was not copied. Is .metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.resources/.projects needed?
 Try deleting ./metadata directory.
 
 9. if project won't open, try deleting .metadata directory
 
 10. log task not running, since tactile_task is higher priority and did not yield.
 /* configUSE_IDLE_HOOK must be set to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h for the idle hook function to get called. */
 Log works after terminating getchar loop.
 Task priorities: section 3.5 of Mastering FreeRTOS
 zero is lowest priority==> log task should be higher priority than tactile reader task
 
 11. need non-blocking getchar, so it can yield to other processes.
 DbgConsole_TryGetchar(&ch);
 from fsl_debug_console.hang
 add DEBUG_CONSOLE_TRANSFER_NON_BLOCKING=1
 Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> MCU C compiler -> Preprocessor
 
 12. ADC Chan 12 works, how to use chan 6b?
 try SDK example, chan 13 works, ADC13=J4-4 is ok,
 #define DEMO_ADC16_BASE ADC1, to use ADC1_SE14=J4-6 and ADC1_SE15=J4-8
 why is it _SE6b?
 
 Try J4-10 which is ADC1_SE7b (pin 83) not working.
 Mux select For A or B channels on SE4-7
 kADC16_ChannelMuxB = 1U, /*!< For channel with channel mux b. */
 need to add this initialization
 void ADC16_SetChannelMuxMode(ADC_Type *base, adc16_channel_mux_mode_t mode)
 adc16MuxStruct = kADC16_ChannelMuxB;
    ADC16_SetChannelMuxMode(DEMO_ADC16_BASE, adc16MuxStruct);
	
13. Reading ScanClk- GPIO read interface?	
 GPIO_PinRead(GPIO_Type *base, uint32_t pin)
 
 14. smartgit could not stage files. Had to make new repo to save them.
 a) create new repo on github.com, save important files, clone on PC
 b) create new MCUXpresso project in new repo directory area
	i) OS-> freertos, driver -> adc, pit
	ii) library NewlibNano semihost, use floating point version of printf, scanbf
 c) copy source and modified files from repo directory to project by 
    by copy paste in MCUXpresso project -> source and pin_mux to board.
missing fsl_ftm.h, also need board.h, board.c, 
need to set SDK_DEBUGCONSOLE=1
also should save .cproject
 d) push to repo

14. Release build gives error about dbgconsole
had to set SDK_DEBUGCONSOLE=1 for release build.
SDK_DEBUGCONSOLE_UART is set for racetimer3. Copy release .bin file to K: drive and reset.
(Close terminal to avoid USB conflict)
Release for Tactile doesn't run, just prints first 5 characters and stops.
Stack limit? Or UART conflict with debugging? Maybe eliminate getchar?
Hangs on printf, should only use PRINTF.

15. python interface: use ee192 telemetry framework?? 
Probably overkill- just use pyserial and write to .csv file or display.
install pyserial: use Anaconda prompt, then conda install pyserial
https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shortintro.html

16. Python plotting: needed to change reader.next() to next(reader) and also to change csv file to text mode
Spyder external plots Tools > Preferences > IPython console > Graphics > Graphics Backend

17. grayscale plot works in example but not in capsensors_serial.py???
Just hangs- something interferes?
input() breaks?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17149646/matplotlib-force-plot-display-and-then-return-to-main-code
print("Note: Will not generate plot until exiting program. matplotlib bug")
==> use plt.show(block=False)  # this blocks on user input
    plt.pause(0.1) 
	
18. how to get start of frame using ser.read_until('Fr',2)   # wait for first character of frame timing
Try reading 1 character, and looking for 'F'
==> need to look for 'b'F'

19. Python can't keep up- only processes 3 lines before next ``Frame''. Maybe need delay between frames. 
use handshaking- send 'r' command to get a frame.
